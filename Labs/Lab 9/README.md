# Lab 9

We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

We would keep this simple for our website and use AWS as this is easy, free and we are only going to be using this website for this class and portfolio purposes. The domain name that we would use would be a cheap and available, something that wouldn't be very costly to keep runnning as this website wouldn't be needed to be used by many people often, most liekly using AWS. After this I would probably not need Google drive integration or anything, so I would move to getting my website woking with Docker.
